# Project-0

Please note that, this project will **NOT** be graded. However, there are many useful tools that you will learn in this project, so I strongly recomend that you spend considerable amount of time in this project. You will definitely use the experience you gained in this project.

## Project Topic:

Simulate a DC motor using in Simulink [Simscape Power Systems](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simpower.html). Although the Mathworks webpage has [lots of examples](https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sps/getting-started-with-simpowersystems.html), I advise yo to start with simpler tutorials. There are tons of tutorials online, here just a few you can start with:

- [Simulink Basics](https://faculty.unlv.edu/eelabs/docs/guides/Simulink_Basics_Tutorial.pdf)
- [Simulink Tutorial](http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen2060/materials/simulink/tutorial/MATLAB_Simulink_tutorial.pdf)
- [Simulink training](http://www.fsd.mw.tum.de/wp-content/uploads/Training_TUM_GS_Simulink_14b.pdf)

In the project, you should model a DC motor, and please simulate the starting process of the motor (i.e from stationary to rated speed). You can build your own models, or use any other simple models, but there is a [Chopper-Fed DC Motor Drive Example](https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sps/examples/chopper-fed-dc-motor-drive-continuous.html) in Mathworks webpage which you can use (but please try to understand how it works than directly running it).

Besides building a DC motor model, you should prepare a short report including following info:

- A short info about the motor (voltage, current, power ratings etc)
- Short info about the power source and control system
- Graphs showing acceleration curve from stationary to rated speed.
- Start-up current graphs
- Produced torque during startup
- Bibliography (Please mention if you used someone else's model)

In short, your repo should include:

- The simulink file of your model
- The report explaining how the model works.
