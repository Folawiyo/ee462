## Project 1 - Evaluation Guideline

The project will be evaluated using the following guideline:

**Number of Commits:25%:** The number of edits of your project files as seen from the contributors list. For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you’ll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you’ll get full credit. The project topics are not easy, so this is a way to encourage you to start early and work regularly.

**Level of Information:50%:** The detail level of your designs (see requirements above), and the accuracy of your calculations.

**Report Quality:25%:** Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.


## Number of Commits:

In this project the expected number of commits on different days is 5. Each days you made at least one commit is 4 points (saturating at 20 points). Thus, if you made 4 commits at 2 days, you'll get 10 points. The following rules apply:

- You commit has be a meaninful and considerable change has to be made with the previous version. For example, just changing a few words in your report is not a meaninful commit.

- Number of days that you committed will be evaluated by common sense. For example, a commit at 23:59 and another commit at 00:02 will still count as one.

- Do not try to find a workaround. Just spend time on your project, and improve your models regularly and it should be fine.

You'll get 5 points from your commit messages. You are supposed to write clear and explanatory commit messages, listing what changes you made in that version. Please have a look at the following links:
