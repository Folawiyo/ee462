## Project 1 - Evaluation Guideline

The project will be evaluated using the following guideline:

**Number of Commits:25%:** The number of edits of your project files as seen from the contributors list. For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you’ll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you’ll get full credit. The project topics are not easy, so this is a way to encourage you to start early and work regularly.

**Report Quality:25%:** Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.

**Technical Level of Information:50%:** The detail level of your designs (see requirements above), and the accuracy of your calculations.

## Number of Commits:

In this project the expected number of commits on different days is 5. Each days you made at least one commit is 4 points (saturating at 20 points). Thus, if you made 4 commits at 2 days, you'll get 10 points. The following rules apply:

- You commit has be a meaninful and considerable change has to be made with the previous version. For example, just changing a few words in your report is not a meaninful commit.

- Number of days that you committed will be evaluated by common sense. For example, a commit at 23:59 and another commit at 00:02 will still count as one.

- Do not try to find a workaround. Just spend time on your project, and improve your models regularly and it should be fine.

You'll get 5 points from the content of your commit messages. You are supposed to write clear and explanatory commit messages, listing what  specific improvements that you made in that version. Please have a look at the following links:

## Report Quality:

You report quality will be evaluated using the following criteria:

- The report has a separate title page (2pts*)
- The report has a table of contents page (2pts*)
- The report has an introduction section that briefly explains the content of the report (3pts)
- The report organized properly with clear sections and subsections (2pts)
- All figures and tables have proper captions (3pts)
- The graphs have proper axes labels and font size of labels is adequate (3pts)
- The graphs does not have the [default black background](people.uncw.edu/hermanr/mat361/Printing%20Simulink%20Scope%20Image.pdf), and line colors are distinguishable (2pts)
- All grammar/spelling correct and very well-written (hint: for a start use spell-check) (3pts)
- The report has a conclusion section that summarizes what have been done (3pts)
- The report has a [bibliography](http://www.plagiarism.org/citing-sources/whats-a-bibliography/) section and all the external sources [have been cited properly](http://libguides.mit.edu/citing). Note that, this is for formatting of the citations. Any [plagiarism](http://www.plagiarism.org/plagiarism-101/what-is-plagiarism) will not be tolerated. (2pts)

(*) These points do not apply for reports written in Markdown. For those reports you"ll get the points automatically.

## Level of Information:

For this project following will be checked in your reports and in your models:

- All three models are running properly. (3pts)
- The results are consistent with each other. (3pts)
- Analysis: Part-1 results (3pts)
- Analysis: Part-2 results (3pts)
- Analysis: Part-3 results (3pts)
- Comments: Part-1 (10pts)
- Comments: Part-2 (10pts)
- Comments: Part-3 (10pts)
- Model quality (5pts)

**Model Quality**
- Model filenames are proper and self-explanatory
- Model is [neat](http://blogs.mathworks.com/pick/2014/04/25/clean-up-your-simulink-model/) and tidy.
- All signals in the model are properly labeled.
